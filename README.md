### This repo is an attempt to help in learning popular sorting algorithms by visualization

Helps to

- understand the working of sorting algorithm
- check total swaps required
- check total comparisions
- compare algorithms side by side

Features

- Sort any given array of 3 digits positive integers
- Start, pause and reset the execution
- Generate random array of numbers of sorting

### Technologies

- React with hooks
- Typescript
- TailWind css


### Features built using

- Animations are done using  tailWind css and uses
- Flex is used for array display and manipulation of positions (flex order property)
- typeScript with react Hooks are used heavily for the controlled execution of algorithms

### Run in your local

- ```git clone https://github.com/BHARATHI-GIT-HUB/Sorting-Visualizer-TS.git```
- ```npm install``` (after navigating inside the directory)
- ```npm run dev```
